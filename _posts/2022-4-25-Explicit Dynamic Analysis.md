**Need of explicit dynamic analysis**

1. To simulate the buckling and complex contact problem.
2. To model material deformation and failure at high strain rate.
3. To model the formation and motion of shock waves.
4. To accurately simulate the short duration high energy events.
5. To simulate the crash, impact, ballast and drop test related problems.

**Explicit dynamics application areas**
There are various application areas where explicit dynamic analysis is to be performed. Some of them are as under-

1. When the dynamic load duration is too short just like pulse load.
2. When there are extreme loadings like impact.
3. Where there is a case of failure at material level.
4. When there exists a structural and material non-linearity.
5. When there is a case of large deformation and high strain rates.
6. When there is a buckling instability and contact related problem.

**Examples**

1. Crash in the vehicle industry
2. Train car impact
3. Pressure pulse load on a block
4. Bullet impact on a plate
5.  Impact loading on a RCC beam

**Material Libraries for explicit dynamic analysis in Ansys**

1. Explicit materials (include materials having time dependent behavior)
2. General non-linear materials.
